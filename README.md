# threeBodies
Creating a simulation of the three-body problem

In this repo, i created 3 bodies, each having a mass and simulate how they will pull each other with their gravitational force

I used the pygame library to make things easier.

This is just for fun, no big plans with it:)

P.S. If you want, you can experiment with even more bodies (or planets, suns, if you wish). You only have to modify the csv file to add details about more bodies.
